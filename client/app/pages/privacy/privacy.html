  <h1>We're serious about privacy</h1>
  We know your photos are important to you and that they're private. It's our policy to maintain complete privacy of our customers' photos. We don't share them or any of your personal information with any third parties--not even advertising networks. We know our service is useful and doesn't require subsidies from ad revenue to keep us happy. Your other personal information, including your credit card information is stored in a secure PCI-compliant facility apart from Apertura and will never be shared either.
